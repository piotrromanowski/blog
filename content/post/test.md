# New Redesign!

Yes, you read that correctly, but hopefully for the last time. I've decided
to move my website to hugo[https://themes.gohugo.io/] so that blogging is
less tedious.

The history of this website....

I started with the original website back sometime in 2013 when I started my
first software engineering internship/job. Back then the website was hosted
on digital ocean as a [Play!](https://www.playframework.com/) app. I originally
created that website as a way to learn more about the framework, since I was
going to use it at work, and to learn how to host my own website.

Since then then website was rewritten using various frameworks, languages, and
hosting services. Each time I started learning a new frontend framework, I rewrote
parts of the website using that tech. (Ember, Angular, React, etc...) I did the
same as I learned new backend languages and rewrote the http server and even
swapped out different databases.

One downside of all this rewriting is that I lost much of the original posts,
and that I would often rewrite the website, and then not produce much new content.
I hope to change that now that I've switched to hosting the blog on github using
[hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Hope you stick around!
