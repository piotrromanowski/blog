# About

Since I can remember, I've always had a deep interest in how things worked. As a
kid, I would get in trouble for "breaking" things when I was trying to get to
their inner workings. Luckily, my passion for video games and building computers
eventually lead me down the path of programming.

Some programming languages that I currently work with, or have worked with
in the past include Java, Python, Go, Node, JavaScript (TypeScript/CoffeeScript).
I have the most experience building CRUD applications with a variety of REST
frameworks, and building intuitive UIs with React. Currently, building backend
services and devops peeks my interest the most. I've been spending much of my
freetime learning how to utilize AWS/Gcloud.

When I'm not coding, you can find me playing video games, spending time outdoors,
hanging out with friends and family, dabbling with the arts, or binging the
next Netflix show. If we share any of the same interest, you should check out my
blog!
